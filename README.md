# Automated Data Analysis with LLM

## Introduction

Welcome to the Automated Data Analysis project! This project leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLM) to analyze a CSV file and generate insightful outputs. The primary goal is to automate the data analysis process, providing a comprehensive report in the form of a `README.md` file, along with visualizations such as heatmaps, correlation matrices, and histograms.

## Project Overview

This project simplifies the process of analyzing large datasets by using an LLM to perform automated data analysis. By providing a CSV file as input, the project generates a detailed analysis report and visualizations that help in understanding the data better.

## Features

- **Automated Data Analysis**: Uses an LLM to analyze the provided CSV file and generate a comprehensive report.
- **Visualizations**: Generates visualizations such as heatmaps, correlation matrices, and histograms.
- **Detailed Report**: Compiles analysis results into a `README.md` file, including a narrative generated by the LLM and visualizations.

### Output

After running the script, the following outputs will be generated:

- **README.md**: A detailed report of the data analysis, including a narrative generated by the LLM.
- **Visualizations**: PNG files of the visualizations generated during the analysis. These include:
  - `correlation_heatmap.png`: A heatmap showing the correlation between numeric columns.
  - `outlier_detection.png`: A boxplot for outlier detection.
  - `histogram_<column>.png`: Histograms for key numeric columns.

## Conclusion

The Automated Data Analysis project simplifies the process of analyzing large datasets by leveraging the power of LLM. By providing a CSV file as input, the project generates a comprehensive report and visualizations that help in understanding the data better. This project is a valuable tool for data analysts, researchers, and anyone working with large datasets.

Feel free to explore the project, run the analysis on your own datasets, and gain valuable insights from the data. Happy analyzing! ðŸ˜Š
